# Overlays Directory

This directory is reserved for future non-repository overlays.

Current package overlays are now managed through the nixautopkgs repository and accessed via the `autopkgs` prefix in user configurations.

For example:

- `autopkgs.gcs` - GCS (GURPS Character Sheet) application
- `autopkgs.opencode` - OpenCode editor

This approach provides automatic updates and centralized package management.
